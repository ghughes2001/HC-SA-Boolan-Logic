# HC-SA-Boolan-Logic

Assume that you are building an artificial neuron that serves as a boolean function and would like to find the three weights of the neuron (Wx, Wy, and Wb).

Using the algorithm of your choice, trace the detailed process of finding the optimal values of the weights in a Google sheet (or MS Excel).
After completing the tracing, implement the algorithm as a computer program to find the optimal values of the weights.
Choose an algorithm to trace and implement (pick one, not both):

HILL-CLIMBING algorithm (Figure 4.2 in the book)
SIMULATED-ANNEALING algorithm (Figure 4.5 in the book)
Choose a basic boolean function to solve (pick one):

AND gate (please don't do this because we already did it in class)
OR gate
NOT gate
NAND gate
NOR gate
Requirements:

Your implementation should exactly match the book's algorithm.
Submit all evidence of your work, including code and screenshots of outputs.
If you worked in a group, describe who did what, how frequently you met, and how work was divided.
For any online work, such as a work in Google Sheets, an accompanying PDF or file version should be submitted (you are welcome to include a URL too)
Please refer to the classroom discussions to understand how to trace HC/SA in a Google sheet.
You are welcome to work in a group of a maximum of 2 students.
For your code implementation, try three different temperature schedules and discuss the comparison, i.e., how it affects the optimization process.
Your project report should be prepared in Overleaf, and the first paragraph should describe the problem you are solving; Non-Overleaf submission will receive a zero. Please see the Syllabus for a tutorial.
Your report should also include discussions about your challenges while working on the project.
In three separate graphs, plot the values of temperate, delta E, and value of the objective function over iterations. For example, the first plot will be temperature against iterations.
Additional notes:

If you work on the HC algorithm (and not SA), your group will qualify to receive only 90% of the maximum points possible.
A few random groups of students may be asked for an in-person meeting to explain their project, and their grades may be adjusted accordingly.
